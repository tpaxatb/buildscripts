These are build scripts for the individal libraries/toolchain.  By default they
build for linux.  They are dumb.  They could be consolodated but I'm pretty
lazy.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
---------------------
In order for libtool libraries to build properly on 64bit mingw targets, you
*MUST* use a recent libtool from the trunk.  Otherwise import libraries aren't
scanned properly.

In addition, I *strongly* suggest regenerating the library directory configure
scripts, etc with recent versions of autoconf and automake (2.65 and 1.11.1 are
pretty decent).  You'll have to do this anyway if you are getting for the
first time from the source repositories.
