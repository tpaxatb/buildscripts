These patches are semi-organized as branches off the gcc 4.5 trunk.

base-patches contains patches that are basically fixes and patches gleaned
from the mailing lists, plus a few other patches of mine.  They should
apply cleanly in order from the svn gcc-4_5-branch.

dll-locations contains patches that are experimental for installing the
runtime DLLs based on the type of compiler being installed.  It is
experimental in the sense that it may not work, it is incomplete, and
it may break 32 bit mingw and/or cygwin builds.  These again should
apply cleanly in order from the svn gcc-4_5-branch.

Also included are merge conflict resolution diffs.  They will
track merge conflicts that occur as patches are added to the branches.

For information about each patch, read the patch itself, as that has
the most information (contains the commit log).
